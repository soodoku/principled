***CODING*
**********

Three different sets of conditions:
1) As programmed: Control, Dem_T, Dem_C, Rep_T, Rep_C
2) In-party or out-party based story: control, in-party, out-party
3) Reaction: control in-party ignores, in-party reacts, out-party ignores, out-party reacts

Key variables:
*in-out FT (and component parts: in FT, out FT)
*in-party trait ratings
	-index composed of 4 that seem relevant: open-minded, sincere, (not) ignorant, (not) hypocritical
*out-party trait ratings (and same index)

***ANALYSIS*
************

compare three conditions in cond. list (2) above on DVs
	*t-test of in-out FT by "in-group story" vs. "out-group story" shows apparent effect
	*t-test of in-group trait index by same 2 conditions shows no effect
	*But t-test of out-group trait index shows apparent effect

compare three conditions in cond. list (3) above on DVs
	*summarize variables and run tests comparing "in-party reacts" to "in-party ignores" and "out-party reacts" to "out-party ignores"
		-DVs move in expected directions, but not significant
