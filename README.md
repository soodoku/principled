## Explaining Partisan Affect: Partisan Response to Partisan Response

What causes affective polarization? Past research suggests that the increasing affective gulf between partisans is a result of greater disagreement on policy and growing alignment between social and political identities. In this paper, we propose a third source of interparty animus: partisans' response to opposing partisans' biased response to events. Specifically, we argue that partisans punish their opponents for engaging in blatant motivated reasoning but fail to hold their own side accountable for similar failures. To test this theory, we rely on two experiments that exogenously manipulate perceptions of partisan motivated reasoning among co- and opposing partisans. Results from the first study demonstrate that Republicans exhibit this 'bias blind spot,' though the effects are imprecisely estimated; Democrats, on the other hand, do not appear engage in the same behavior. Instead, we find stronger evidence of 'partisan cheerleading': Democrats and Republicans appear to punish in-party supporters for not sufficiently engaging in biased thinking.  Results from the larger-n, nationally representative study that manipulates perceptions of partisan bias in economic evaluations suggests that seeing opposing partisan respond in a neutral manner makes people think more warmly about them.
